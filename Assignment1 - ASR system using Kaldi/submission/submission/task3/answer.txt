The performance drops because in training, we have a large amount of data from a specific set of speakers and in testing, we have small amount of data from a smaller group of speakers. In line 74, train_deltas.sh uses cmvn.scp and feats.scp that store mean, median like that measures for different speakers. I think it uses those values to cluster speakers and train a speaker selective model, so as to cover the drawback of having different types of features in test set from train set.
